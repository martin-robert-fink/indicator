# indicator
Comparison of two ways to animate an underline indicator between two widgets

Each file is a self contained `main.dart` file (just rename it).  Both project require `get ^3.15.0` to be added to your `pubspec.yaml` to manage the state.

Please comment on your prefered solution at this [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64625045/animate-positioned-container-between-two-separate-widgets)
